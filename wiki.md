## Overview of `Wiki.app`

Henrietta is a business magnate and wants to create a internally facing wiki for 
her organization. She wants her employees to be able to write articles in order 
to inform colleagues about their insights.

## Project Details

### Necessary features

A basic implementation of this project must include:

1. All articles should be editable - Henrietta's is a collaborative workplace
2. If an article is changed, the time of that change should be shown so that 
users can know how up-to-date an article is
3. Henrietta wants users to be able to add a category to an article so that 
articles can be organized
4. Henrietta doesn't mind who authors / edits the wikis (Meaning no User model)

###  Advanced features

Going above and beyond the basic implementation is very desirable, should you 
have the time.

Feel free to enhance your project with any of the following features:

1. Henrietta wants the articles to be written in markdown so that the content is 
visually appealing
2. Employees feel that there should be some accountability so Henrietta is going 
back on her no authors choice. (This means a Users model and authentication!)
3. Employees have complained that they feel constrained by a single category and 
have suggested using multiple tags.
4. Articles should be browsable by tag.

Disavowing pizza and red bull (the stereotypical food choice of developers) you 
have decided to explore New York City's salad offerings.

- While at Chopt, you overheard two developers chatting about how 
[marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) is a great module for rendering markdown.
