## Overview of `Forum.app`

Jake loves discussion amongst his friends, but he wants a way to keep it organized. 
He wants his own forum.

## Project Details

### Necessary features

A basic implementation of this project must include:

1. Jake wants his friends to be able to discuss things by topics. However, 
Jake is also a privacy kind of guy so he doesn't mind everyone being anonymous. 
All anonymous users should be able to create topics, and all users should be 
able to comment on those topics. (BTW - anonymous means we don't actually need a User model)
2. Jake isn't concerned about sub-comments, for now.
3. Jake is a huge fan of Reddit and would like the top voted comments to appear at the top
of each post
4. Jake also wants to be able to see what topics have the most comments.
5. Jake thinks it would be cool if users could vote on topics, and have the 
topics displayed based on popularity.

###  Advanced features

Going above and beyond the basic implementation is very desirable, should you 
have the time.

Feel free to enhance your project with any of the following features:

1. Jake's friends love adding comments to topics, but they want to be able to 
comment on comments
2. Jake is a nerd, and is a fan of proper formatting. He wants everyone to write 
their discussion posts in markdown format.
3. Jake was wrong about his privacy policy and wants his users to have usernames 
and all post/comments attributed to them. (Meaning you will need a User model and
 a login feature)

### Tips

Your friend recently completed WDI and last week you ran into her at 
Neo-Folk/House fusion show in Bushwick. Over the loud basslines and banjo twangs, 
you mention the app Jake wants made.
